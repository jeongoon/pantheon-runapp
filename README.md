# pantheon-runapp
  Launch an application in the elementary OS way.
  If you want to use some apps which is already open, you can just press your own shortcut for the apps.
it will focus the window which you want to use.
  Or if you want to create new windows for the application, you can press twice quickly the same shortcut.
  It works like mouse click and double click.
  
  And I think that pantheon desktop prefer to open one working app from one executable file.
  sometimes I found that it's very handy to open only one application. because I use terminal application
a lot and I opened too many windows after sometimes.

  It supports more hits(or clicks) more than double, which are not used at the moment.

# this is perl-based programme.
  I don't have enough time to learn other language and I would like to learn one.
but perl5 is wildely used in many Linux system. so I think it's not bad choice at all.
  I have a plan for learning perl6 or other script language or "rust"
but I keep focus on making more feature.
